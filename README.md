# Electronics testing for 0vbb experiment

## data

### `*.txt`

- Column1: V_bol(V)
- Column2: I_bol(A)

### `*.xlsx`

- Raw Data generated by Matlab GUI
- The result is stored in above *.txt file

## doc

### [Resistance_measurement.md](https://github.com/Castersorium/0vbbElectronics/blob/master/doc/Resistance_measurement.md)

- Table which recorded measurement conditions and other details
- Currently all of the data was acquired through Milan electronics

## output

- Graphs and Fit results. 
- For newest result, you can check [RTCurve_20-100mK.png](https://github.com/Castersorium/0vbbElectronics/blob/master/output/2023Nov/RTCurve_20-100mK.png) or [RTCurve_20-50mK.png](https://github.com/Castersorium/0vbbElectronics/blob/master/output/2023Nov/RTCurve_20-50mK.png)

### `RTCurve.xlsx`

- Preliminary results for temperature fit of RT Curve

## src

### `plotGraph.C`

- Draw the plots from data
- Use linear fit $$V = R_\mathrm{bol} \cdot I + C$$
- Results are stored in output
- The excluded range that was not fit was due to electronics saturation

### `plotSinGraph.C`

- Draw the plots from data
- The data is fluctuated caused by **PID** controlling phase
- Fit the result with the function $$V = R_\mathrm{bol} \cdot I + Amp \cdot I \cdot \sin(\omega I + \varphi) + C$$
- Results are stored in output
- $\max{R_\mathrm{bol}}=R_\mathrm{bol} + Amp$, at the lowest temperature
- $\min{R_\mathrm{bol}}=R_\mathrm{bol} - Amp$, at the highest temperature
