% Given a dataset this will calculate the spectrogram
%
% Inputs:
%   datalist = two column array with time in first column, data to analyze
%       in second
%   fActual = sample rate of the data in Hertz
%   nSlicesPerSecond = number of slices per second to break up spectrogram
%
% Outputs:
%   x_3D = time for spectrogram
%   y_3D = frequency for spectrogram
%   z_3D = amplitude for spectrogram
